Version 1.3 - 23 May 1998

	* Geyacc has been totally rewritten in Eiffel.
	* Replaced attribute `output_file' by procedure
	  `output' in class YY_SCANNER to avoid unnecessary
	  console creation in Windows mode with Visual Eiffel.
	* Fixed bug in gelex in "equivalence class" mode when
	  dealing with regular expressions of the form x{4}.
	* Added warnings in gelex when a rule cannot be
	  matched and when the default rule can be matched
	  despite the %option nodefault or -s option.
	* Renamed classes KL_SHARED_*_ROUTINES as 
	  KL_IMPORTED_*_ROUTINES. (The old class names are
	  still temporarily valid using the classes in cluster
	  "$GOBO\library\kernel\obsolete".)
	* Gepp now supports #include "filename" instructions.
	* The second generic parameter of DS_HASH_TABLE is now
	  constrained to HASHABLE (HASHABLE was not part of 
	  SmallEiffel in previous releases).
	* Cluster `error' has been added to the Gobo Eiffel
	  Utility Library to support a flexible error
	  reporting mechanism.

Version 1.2 - 17 December 1997

	* New implementation for variable trailing context
	  in gelex, with warnings for dangerous trailing
	  contexts of form such as x*/xz*.
	* Improved documentation.

Version 1.1 - 29 October 1997

	* Bug fixed wrt variable trailing context in gelex.

Version 1.0 - 14 October 1997

	* First public release.
	* Gold Award at the Eiffel Class Struggle '97.
