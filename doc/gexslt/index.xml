  <title>Introduction to &title;</title>
  <para>&title; is a command-line processor for the XSLT 2.0 language. 
  It is very much still under development at the moment, and does not even implement the whole
  of XSLT 1.0 as yet, but it is capable of useful work. In fact, it is used to produce the XHTML pages
  for all of the Gobo documentation that is written in accordance with <filename class="schema">$GOBO/doc/misc/gobo.rng</filename>.

    <title>Status and conformance</title>
    <para>
      &program_name_cased; is intended to conform to a Basic-level XSLT 2.0 Processor. However, no formal
      conformance statement is provided yet. It implements whatever happens to work when you try it.
      The XML and Names 1.1 Feature, the backwards-compatible and serialization features are all implemented. Note however that
      UTF-16 output is not yet supported, nor is Unicode normalization.
    </para>
    <para>
      The implementation status of the core XPath functions can be found at
      <link linkend="../xml/xpath/implemented_functions">Implemented XPath functions</link>
      In summary, all are implemented except normalize-unicode.
    </para>
    <para>
      In general, if a message beginning with TODO appears on the standard error stream, then you should
      not expect your stylesheet to execute correctly. If however, no errors or TODO messages are reported, then output
      should be correct.
    </para>

    <title>Credits</title>
    <para>The architecture and algorithms of the Gobo Eiffel XSLT library, upon which &title; is built,
    are largely derived from <ulink url="http://www.saxonica.com/index.html">Saxon</ulink>, an open source XSLT Processor written in Java, by Michael Kay. 
    I am very grateful to Michael for making the source code available for study, and for answering all my questions.
