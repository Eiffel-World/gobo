  <title>Introduction to Gobo Eiffel XSLT</title>
  <para>Gobo Eiffel XSLT is a command-line processor for the XSLT 2.0 language. 
  It is very much still under development at the moment, and does not even implement the whole
  of XSLT 1.0 as yet, but it is capable of useful work. In fact, it is used to produce the XHTML pages
  for all of the Gobo documentation.

    <para>The architecture and algorithms of the Gobo Eiffel XSLT library, upon which Gobo Eiffel XSLT is built,
    are derived from <ulink url="http://www.saxonica.com/index.html">Saxon</ulink>, an open source XSLT Processor written in Java, by Michael Kay. 
    I am very grateful to Michael for making the source code available for study, and for
    answering all  my questions.
