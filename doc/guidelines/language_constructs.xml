  <para>
    In order to achieve Eiffel compiler interoperability, it is not
    necessarily required to strictly follow the Eiffel standard.  Some
    compilers indeed have bugs, do not interpret the standard in the
    same way as others (be it because of ambiguities in the standard
    itself or not), or have implementation limitations.  Therefore the
    Eiffel dialect used in Gobo Eiffel is likely to be a subset of the
    official Eiffel standard.
  </para>

  <para>
    On the contrary, constructs which have not yet been officially
    adopted by <ulink url="http://www.eiffel-nice.org/">NICE</ulink>,
    but which are already supported by all Eiffel compilers, can be
    used in Gobo Eiffel. For example the
    <constructname>Precursor</constructname> construct was used by
    Gobo before it was formally adopted. However it is clear that an
    Eiffel extension can be used in Gobo Eiffel only if it is
    supported by all Eiffel compilers. Therefore the
    <constructname>agent</constructname> construct introduced in ISE
    Eiffel should not be used at the moment.
  </para>

  <para>
    Differences between the various Eiffel compilers which have
    been already noticed, along with workarounds when available,
    will be listed on-line in order to help others to avoid making
    the same mistakes by using these non-portable Eiffel constructs.
