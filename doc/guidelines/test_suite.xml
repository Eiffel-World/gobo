	<title>Test Suite</title>

  <para>
    Each Eiffel library should come with a test suite runnable with
    <command>getest</command>. The test case classes should be placed
    in <filename>$GOBO/test/[library-name]</filename> along with the
    Ace files, loadpath files, ESD files and the
    <command>getest</command> configuration files to run the tests.
  </para>

  <para>
    The purpose of these tests is to make sure that the library
    classes work as expected (i.e. as specified by the assertions)
    and also to make sure that they compile correctly with compilers
    such as SmartEiffel which compiles only alive code.
  </para>

  <para>
    These tests are also useful for library maintainers who have
    not access to all supported Eiffel compilers or to some
    operating systems. That way the maintainers can ask others
    from the Gobo development team to run the tests on other
    platforms or with other compilers for them.
  </para>

  <para>
    Finally the <filename>$GOBO/test/[library-name]</filename>
    directory is used as regression test to make sure that no new bugs
    have been introduced between two releases.
  </para>

  <para>
    Note: <command>getest</command> is based on Jim Weirich's
    <command>eunit</command> tool but has the advantage to work with
    all Eiffel compilers supported by the Gobo Eiffel project.
  </para>
