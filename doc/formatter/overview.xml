  <para>
    The Gobo Formatter library gives Eiffel programmers access to the
    functionality of the Standard C library sprintf. This library is
    fully implemented in Eiffel. It does not use the C function.
  </para>

  <para>
    The correctnes of the formats can not be evaluated at compile
    time. In fact no format can be checked completely at compile time
    as the final appearence on paper or on the screen must be verifyed
    by a human in each case.
  </para>

  <para>
    In each case it it possible to control at runtime with
    preconditions:
  </para>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem><para>the syntactical correctness of the format
    string.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>the relation between the format string and the other
    parameters.</para></listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>
    So the approach is not completely unsave. Part of the class
    declaration is a set of routines checking the properness of
    format string and parameters.

    <title>History</title>

    <para>
      The Formatter library was originally developed by SIG Computer
      GmbH as part of Eiffel/S. This company was renamed to Object
      Tools. This company put this library in the public domain by
      licensing it under the Eiffel Forum License, version 1. It was
      ported by Friedrich Dominicus to other Eiffel compilers. This
      code is based on Friedrich Dominicus work.
