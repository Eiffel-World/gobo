TODO for Gobo XML

Items prefixed with 'enhancement' are not release critical and are open to 
discussion.

EXPAT:

- apply string modes (generating UC_STRING vs. STRING)
- use external resolvers for entities/DTD

EIFFEL:

- xml declaration for entities event and parsing (rm special scanner?)
- Better error message when failing to resolve DTD
- Check that stand alone handling makes some sense
- Parse ":" name in pedantic XML 1.0 mode for tests
- enhancement: Do CRLF normalisation before parser instead of downstream mess?
- enhancement: review XM_EIFFEL_PARSER_NAME

GENERAL:

- Tree attribute make require not duplicate attribute, or invariant
- Tree pipe to include concatenation and comment filters
- check XM_FORMATTER handling of namespaces
- DTD model should contain attribute enumeration decls
- actually checking tree nodes's parent /= Void (creation issue)
- where does the end tag checker belong (filter or parser)?
- enhancement: XM_DOCUMENT.make_root obsolete as before
- enhancement: Add some generic DTD filters, eg pretty print
- enhancement: XM_EIFFEL_DECLARATION -> XM_DECLARATION
- enhancement: Obsolete/hide nodes' `set_parent', ordinary `make'?
- enhancement: Tree clipboard
- enhancement: Cache queries by name in tree?
- enhancement: XM_ELEMENT.is_root_element

TESTS:

- more latin-1 tests
- more extensive tree tests
- full OASIS test suite to integrate
- DTD events testing
- XM_FORMATTER tests

DOC:

- start with simple code example
- all
