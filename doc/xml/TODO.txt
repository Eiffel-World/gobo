TODO for Gobo XML

EXPAT:

- apply string modes (generating UC_STRING vs. STRING)
- use external resolvers for entities/DTD

EIFFEL:

- Test ISO latin 1
- xml declaration for entities event and parsing (rm special scanner?)
- Better error message when failing to resolve DTD
- Check that stand alone handling makes some sense
- Parse ":" name in pedantic XML 1.0 mode for tests
- Q: Do CRLF normalisation before parser instead of 
  downstream mess?
- Q: review XM_EIFFEL_PARSER_NAME

GENERAL:

- Tree pipe to include concatenation and comment filters
- check XM_FORMATTER handling of namespaces
- DTD model should contain attribute enumeration decls
- Add some generic DTD filters, eg pretty print
- Q: cache queries by name in tree?
- Q: where does the end tag checker belong (filter or parser)?

TESTS:

- test tree's by_name routines
- full OASIS test suite to integrate
- DTD events testing
- XM_FORMATTER tests

DOC:

- start with simple code example
- all
