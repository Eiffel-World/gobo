- Check that stand alone handling makes some sense
- enhancement: strings mode to default to STRING-only latin1 using Max_char_code
- enhancement: Do CRLF normalisation before parser instead of downstream mess?
- enhancement: review XM_EIFFEL_PARSER_NAME

GENERAL:

- Tree pipe to include concatenation and comment filters
- Tree attribute make require not duplicate attribute, or invariant
- actually checking tree nodes's parent /= Void (creation issue)
- enhancement: XM_DOCUMENT.make_root obsolete as before
- enhancement: XM_EIFFEL_DECLARATION -> XM_DECLARATION, add to tree
- enhancement: Obsolete/hide nodes' `set_parent', ordinary `make'?
- enhancement: Tree clipboard
- enhancement: Cache queries by name in tree?
- enhancement: XM_ELEMENT.is_root_element
- enhancement: move DTD classes to own cluster
- enhancement: tree, use DS_LIST is_addable
- enhancement: XM_FORMATTER using whitespace for layout/ whitespace normalisation
