  <title>Core functions - implementation status</title>
  <para>This chapter lists all the core functions (functions provided by host languages such as XSLT are not listed here)
   along with their implementation status.
  </para> 
  <para>The first column of the table gives the function's name, from <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/">XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators</ulink>.
   The fn prefix represents the namespace uri http://www.w3.org/2003/11/xpath-functions.</para>
  <para>To translate the function name into it's implementation class (which can be found in $GOBO/library/xml/xpath/functions/), remove
   the leading fn:, uppercase the remaining part of the name, and translate any hyphens into underscores. Then prefix it with XM_XPATH_.
   For example, the function fn:normalize-space, is implemented by <classname>XM_XPATH_NORMALIZE_SPACE</classname>.
  </para>
  <para>All such classes are descendants of <classname>XM_XPATH_SYSTEM_FUNCTION</classname>. They also each have an entry in 
   <classname>XM_XPATH_SYSTEM_FUNCTION_FACTORY</classname>.
  </para>
  <para>The second column says whether or not the function has been implemented yet. The third column indicates
   whether there is a testing class set up for the function. If so, it will be in $GOBO/test/xml/xpath/, and will be named xm_xpath_test_&lt;function-name&gt;.e .
  </para>
  <para>The final column gives a link to the W3C draft or recommendation against which the tests have been checked, or &quot;None&quot;, if this has not been done. </para>
