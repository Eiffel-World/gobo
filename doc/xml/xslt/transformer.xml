  <title>Creating a Transformer</title>
  <para>
    Once you have an executable stylesheet, you need to create an <classname>XM_XSLT_TRANSFORMER</classname>
    from it. This is accomplished by calling <featurecall><featurename>new_transformer</featurename></featurecall>
    on the <classname>XM_XSLT_PREPARED_STYLESHEET</classname>.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <classname>XM_XSLT_PREPARED_STYLESHEET</classname> is supposed to be serially reusable. That is, once
    you have executed one transform with the transformer you obtained from it, you can create another transformer
    from it. You do not have to re-compile the stylesheet.
  </para>
  <para>
    However, you should <emphasis>not</emphasis> attempt to run two transformations at once (not even if they involve different stylesheets),
    and you should <emphasis>not</emphasis> reuse a transformer - always create a new one for each transformation.
  </para>
