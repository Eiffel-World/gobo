HACT (Halstenbach)

	* The Halstenbach compiler is not supported anymore.

ISE 5.4/5.5 (ISE Eiffel)

	* The Ace files for ISE Eiffel provided in this package are for
	  Eiffel classic. In order to get Ace files configured for Eiffel
	  for .NET, you will need to set the environment variable
	  $GOBO_DOTNET, and the run the following commands:

	    set GOBO_DOTNET=true
	    cd %GOBO%
	    geant clobber
	    geant install

SE 2.1 (SmartEiffel)

	* The millisecond part of KL_SYSTEM_CLOCK, DT_SYSTEM_CLOCK and
	  DT_UTC_SYSTEM_CLOCK may be stuck to zero under Windows.

	* Although this is perfectly correct Eiffel, SmartEiffel complains about
	  Eiffel identifiers containing upper-case letters. There is a lot of
	  these identifiers automatically generated by `gelex' and `geyacc'. In
	  order to avoid being overwhelmed by zillions of unjustified warning
	  messages, please use the option -no_style_warning.

	* Futhermore, SmartEiffel has decided to make the live of portable
	  Eiffel library developers even more difficult than it used to be
	  by departing from the Eiffel standard without raising the issue
	  at NICE or ECMA. If like me you are sick of getting zillions of
	  warning messages because of that please use the options -no_warning
	  AND complain to the SmartEiffel team (otherwise one day these
	  warnings will become fatal errors and Gobo will not be able to
	  support SmartEiffel anymore; this is what already happened
	  with ANY.same_type).

SE 1.0 (SmartEiffel)

	* The Gobo Eiffel package has been configured to work with SE 2.1.
	  If you are using SE 1.0, you will need to set the environment
	  variable $SE_1_0, and then run the following commands to reconfigure
	  the package with SE 1.0:

	    set SE_1_0=true
	    cd %GOBO%
	    geant clobber
	    geant install

VE 5.0a (Visual Eiffel)

	* Some Eiffel distributions such as Visual Eiffel may provide older
	  versions of the Gobo tools in their installation directories.
	  Make sure that $GOBO/bin is listed before these directories in
	  your $PATH.

	* Visual Eiffel does not consider that the default value for
	  'console_application' in Xace is true, so this option has to
	  be explicitly set in system.xace files.

	* Visual Eiffel requires that the current working directory be
	  one of the clusters listed in the Xace file. So either you
	  launch the compilation in one of the directories listed in
	  the Xace file, or you add the following line in your system.xace
	  file:

	    <cluster name="<app_name>_ve" location="." if="${GOBO_EIFFEL}=ve"/>

	  where <app_name> stands for the name of your application.

	* Running 'geant test_debug_ve' in $GOBO/test/kernel make the test
	  crash. It seems to be a bug in the compiler or its runtime/GC.

	* There is a linking error when trying to compile the test in
	  $GOBO/test/xml/expat.

VE 4.1 (Visual Eiffel)

	* The Gobo Eiffel package has been configured to work with VE 5.0.
	  If you are using VE 4.1, you will need to set the environment
	  variable $VE_4_1, and then run the following commands to reconfigure
	  the package with VE 4.1:

	    set VE_4_1=true
	    cd %GOBO%
	    geant clobber
	    geant install
