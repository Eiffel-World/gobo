HACT (Halstenbach)

	* The Halstenbach compiler is not supported anymore.

ISE 5.5/5.6 (ISE Eiffel)

	* The Ace files for ISE Eiffel provided in this package are for
	  Eiffel classic. In order to get Ace files configured for Eiffel
	  for .NET, you will need to set the environment variable
	  $GOBO_DOTNET, and then run the following commands:

	    set GOBO_DOTNET=true
	    cd %GOBO%
	    geant clobber
	    geant install

	* The decimal tests fail when compiled with ISE 5.5 for .NET.

SE 2.2b1 (SmartEiffel)

	* KL_PLATFORM.Double_bits is not supported anymore. This is a 
	  consequence of DOUBLE being deprecated in SmartEiffel and
	  hence not supporting the required features.

	* The millisecond part of KL_SYSTEM_CLOCK, DT_SYSTEM_CLOCK and
	  DT_UTC_SYSTEM_CLOCK may be stuck to zero under Windows.

	*  The compiler crashes when compiling gexslt and some of the
	   XML tests in boost mode with GC included.

	* Although this is perfectly correct Eiffel, SmartEiffel complains about
	  Eiffel identifiers containing upper-case letters. There is a lot of
	  these identifiers automatically generated by `gelex' and `geyacc'. In
	  order to avoid being overwhelmed by zillions of unjustified warning
	  messages, please use the option -no_style_warning.

	* Furthermore, SmartEiffel has decided to make the life of portable
	  Eiffel library developers even more difficult than it used to be
	  by departing from the Eiffel standard without raising the issue
	  at NICE or ECMA. If like me you are sick of getting zillions of
	  warning messages because of that please use the options -no_warning
	  AND complain to the SmartEiffel team (otherwise one day these
	  warnings will become fatal errors and Gobo will not be able to
	  support SmartEiffel anymore; this is what already happened
	  with ANY.same_type).

SE 2.1 (SmartEiffel)

	* Same remarks as with SE 2.2b1 above.

	* UC_STRING.infix "@" does not work as expected. It works well
	  with the SE 2.2b1 and SE 1.0 though. This is the consequence
	  of the fact that STRING.infix "@" as been marked as frozen in
	  SE 2.2b1.

SE 1.0 (SmartEiffel)

	* The Gobo Eiffel package has been configured to work with SE 2.1.
	  If you are using SE 1.0, you will need to set the environment
	  variable $SE_1_0, and then run the following commands to reconfigure
	  the package with SE 1.0:

	    set SE_1_0=true
	    cd %GOBO%
	    geant clobber
	    geant install

VE 5.0b build 2508 (Visual Eiffel)

	* The decimal classes violate invariants inherited from class
	  NUMERIC. You should compile them with invariant monitoring off.

	* Some Eiffel distributions such as Visual Eiffel may provide older
	  versions of the Gobo tools in their installation directories.
	  Make sure that $GOBO/bin is listed before these directories in
	  your $PATH.

	* Visual Eiffel does not consider that the default value for
	  'console_application' in Xace is true, so this option has to
	  be explicitly set in system.xace files.

	* Visual Eiffel requires that the current working directory be
	  one of the clusters listed in the Xace file. So either you
	  launch the compilation in one of the directories listed in
	  the Xace file, or you add the following line in your system.xace
	  file:

	    <cluster name="<app_name>_ve" location="." if="${GOBO_EIFFEL}=ve"/>

	  where <app_name> stands for the name of your application.

	* There is a linking error when trying to compile the test in
	  $GOBO/test/xml/expat under Windows. In order to work around this
	  problem you have to convert the format of 'libexpat.lib' to the
	  old lib format using the following command:

	    lib /convert libexpat.lib

	  Note that you have to use 'lib.exe' provided with MSVC 6.0,
	  the version in MSVC 7.1 does not support the option /convert.

VE 5.0b build 2507 (Visual Eiffel)

	* Same remarks as with VE 5.0b build 2508 above.

	* Running 'geant test_debug_ve' in $GOBO/test/kernel under Windows
	  makes the test crash. In order to fix this problem, you have to
	  use the version of class DIRECTORY which can be found in:

	    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/visualeiffel/visualeiffel/lib/misc/pool/io/

VE 4.1 (Visual Eiffel)

	* Not supported anymore.
