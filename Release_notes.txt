HACT 4.0 (Halstenbach)

ISE 5.2 (ISE Eiffel)

	* The Ace files for ISE Eiffel provided in this package are for
	  Eiffel classic. In order to get Ace files configured for Eiffel
	  for .NET, you will need to set the environment variable
	  $GOBO_DOTNET, and the run the following commands:

	    set GOBO_DOTNET=true
	    cd %GOBO%
	    geant clobber
	    geant install

ISE 5.1 (ISE Eiffel)

	* The Gobo Eiffel package has been configured to work with ISE 5.2.
	  If you are using ISE 5.1, you will need to set the environment
	  variable $ISE_5_1, and then run the following commands to reconfigure
	  the package with ISE 5.1:

	    cd $GOBO
	    geant clobber
	    geant install

SE -0.74 (SmallEiffel)

	* Although this is perfectly correct Eiffel, SmallEiffel complains about
	  Eiffel identifiers containing upper-case letters. There is a lot of
	  these identifiers automatically generated by `gelex' and `geyacc'. In
	  order to avoid being overwhelmed by zillions of unjustified warning
	  messages, please use the option -no_style_warning.

	* The SmallEiffel compiler crashes when compiling the examples
	  'formatter' and 'namespaces' in '$GOBO/example/xml/tree'.

VE 4.0 (Visual Eiffel)

	* Some Eiffel distributions such as Visual Eiffel provide older
	  versions of the Gobo tools in their installation directories.
	  Make sure that $GOBO/bin is listed before these directories in
	  your $PATH.

VE 4.1 (Visual Eiffel)

	* Some Eiffel distributions such as Visual Eiffel provide older
	  versions of the Gobo tools in their installation directories.
	  Make sure that $GOBO/bin is listed before these directories in
	  your $PATH.
