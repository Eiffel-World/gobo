    . Input routines such as `read_character' from class CONSOLE do not
      work as expected under Windows. When one writes something like:

            from
                    !! a_string.make
                    io.input.read_character
            until
                    io.input.last_character = 'a'
            loop
                    a_string.append_character (io.input.last_character)
                    io.input.read_character
            end

      and then enters the following input on the keyboard:

            hello
            world
            letter a
            skipped
            a

      one gets the following characters in `a_string':

            "hwls"

      instead of:

            "hello%Nworld%Nletter "

      This is because of a bug in `read_character' which reads only the first
      character and discards the rest of the line.

      This bug prevents some of the examples using IO input (such as the
      calculator examples) from working.
