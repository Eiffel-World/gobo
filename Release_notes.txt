ISE 5.2 (ISE Eiffel)

ISE 5.1 (ISE Eiffel)

	* The Gobo Eiffel package has been configured to work with ISE 5.2.
	  If you are using ISE 5.1, you will need to set the environment
	  variable $ISE_5_1, and then run the following commands to reconfigure
	  the package with ISE 5.1:

	    cd $GOBO
	    geant clobber
	    geant install

SE -0.74 (SmallEiffel)

	* Although this is perfectly correct Eiffel, SmallEiffel complains about
	  Eiffel identifiers containing upper-case letters. There is a lot of
	  these identifiers automatically generated by `gelex' and `geyacc'. In
	  order to avoid being overwhelmed by zillions of unjustified warning
	  messages, please use the option -no_style_warning.
