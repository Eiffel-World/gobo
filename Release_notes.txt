ISE 5.6 (ISE Eiffel)

	* The Ace files for ISE Eiffel provided in this package are for
	  Eiffel classic. In order to get Ace files configured for Eiffel
	  for .NET, you will need to set the environment variable
	  $GOBO_DOTNET, and then run the following commands:

	    set GOBO_DOTNET=true
	    cd %GOBO%
	    geant clobber
	    geant install

SE 1.2r6 (SmartEiffel)

VE 5.0b build 2508 (Visual Eiffel)

	* The decimal classes violate invariants inherited from class
	  NUMERIC. You should compile them with invariant monitoring off.

	* Some Eiffel distributions such as Visual Eiffel may provide older
	  versions of the Gobo tools in their installation directories.
	  Make sure that $GOBO/bin is listed before these directories in
	  your $PATH.

	* Visual Eiffel does not consider that the default value for
	  'console_application' in Xace is true, so this option has to
	  be explicitly set in system.xace files.

	* Visual Eiffel requires that the current working directory be
	  one of the clusters listed in the Xace file. So either you
	  launch the compilation in one of the directories listed in
	  the Xace file, or you add the following line in your system.xace
	  file:

	    <cluster name="<app_name>_ve" location="." if="${GOBO_EIFFEL}=ve"/>

	  where <app_name> stands for the name of your application.

	* There is a linking error when trying to compile the test in
	  $GOBO/test/xml/expat under Windows. In order to work around this
	  problem you have to convert the format of 'libexpat.lib' to the
	  old lib format using the following command:

	    lib /convert libexpat.lib

	  Note that you have to use 'lib.exe' provided with MSVC 6.0,
	  the version in MSVC 7.1 does not support the option /convert.
