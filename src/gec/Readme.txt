WARNING: THIS TOOL IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!

This directory contains the source code of Gobo Eiffel Compiler (gec).
The code of gec is mainly based on the Gobo Eiffel Tools Library.

To compile this program:

1. Use your favorite Eiffel compiler to compile the Eiffel system using
   the provided Ace file (ISE Eiffel: ise.ace, SmartEiffel: se.ace) or
   ESD file (Visual Eiffel: ve.esd). Alternatively you can use 'geant'
   to launch the compilation:
   
       geant compile_<compiler>
       
   where <compiler> is either 'ise', 've' or 'se'.

2. Run gec using:

       gec <acefile>

A more detailed documentation for gec will be provided in
future releases.
