Other Libraries

These Libraries are not properly speaking part of Gobo Eiffel. They
are either contributions to the Gobo Eiffel Project, or third-party
Eiffel libraries whose class interfaces have been kept but where
the implementation has been replaced by inheriting from Gobo Eiffel
library classes.

Clusters:

EiffelBase
    Main ISE EiffelBase containers such as LINKED_LIST or HASH_TABLE
    whose features have been implemented by inheriting from the
    Gobo Eiffel Structure Library classes. A more detailed
    documentation for this cluster, in HTML format, is provided
    in "$GOBO/doc/structure/base.html".
EiffelTime
    Main ISE EiffelTime classes such as DATE or TIME_DURATION
    whose features have been implemented by inheriting from the
    Gobo Eiffel Time Library classes.
