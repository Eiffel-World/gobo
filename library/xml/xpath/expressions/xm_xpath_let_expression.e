	analyze (env: XM_XPATH_STATIC_CONTEXT): XM_XPATH_EXPRESSION is
			-- Perform static analysis of an expression and its subexpressions;		
			-- This checks statically that the operands of the expression have the correct type;
			-- If necessary it generates code to do run-time type checking or type conversion;
			-- A static type error is reported only if execution cannot possibly succeed, that
			-- is, if a run-time type error is inevitable. The call may return a modified form of the expression;
			-- This routine is called after all references to functions and variables have been resolved
			-- to the declaration of the function or variable. However, the types of such functions and
			-- variables will only be accurately known if they have been explicitly declared
