WARNING: THIS LIBRARY IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!

Gobo Eiffel Tools Library

The Gobo Eiffel Tools Library is a portable Eiffel class library
to make easier the development of Eiffel tools such as Eiffel
pretty-printers or flat-short tools. This library contains a
LACE parser to analyze Ace files, an Eiffel parser which builds
abstract syntax trees out of Eiffel source code, and routines
to process these abstract syntax trees. The Gobo Eiffel Tools
Library is primarily used to develop Gobo Eiffel Lint (gelint).

Clusters:

ast
    Abstract syntax tree classes.
error
    Error message classes used throughout this library.
parser
    LACE and Eiffel parsers.

A more detailed documentation for this library will be provided in
future releases.
