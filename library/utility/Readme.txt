Gobo Eiffel Utility Library

This library contains pattern classes as described in "Design Patterns"
from the "Gang of Four", and utility classes which does not deserve to
have a library on their own. The aim of this library is to always be under
construction.

Clusters:

command
    Executable commands. Useful to encapsulate actions or to build
    history (undo-redo) mechanism.
error
    Error messages and error handling cluster.
formatter
    Formatter classes for IO operations or string handling.
spec
    Eiffel compiler dependent classes (filenames suffixed by
    ".ge" instead of ".e" in other clusters).
support
    Miscellaneous classes.

A more detailed documentation for this library will be provided in
future releases.
